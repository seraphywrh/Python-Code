## Cloud Based Multi-player Game

Designed a cloud-based game which can be played by 2 players simultaneously.

Used ZMQ to provide function of sockets by which clients and the server can send messages to each other.

   - Publish-Subscribe pattern of ZMQ.
   - Games run on local clients.
   - Clients gather messages and playerâ€™s input and send to server.
   - Once the server receives a message, it sends this message to all clients.
   - All clients react to commands from server.

Imported pygame library to realize game functions.

Built the computing server on EC2.

Client sends HTTP protocol messages to the erver.

The server listens on a specified port and returns response messages to the client.

Supports 200, 404, and 501 status codes.
